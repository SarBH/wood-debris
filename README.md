# wood-debris
This repo contains data and files for the image segmentation task for wood debris detection.

The data folder has two subfolders: unlabeled and labeled.

The helper-code folder contains helper functions I wrote such as resize_images.py and convert_to_mask.py.



The problem of wood debris quantification on forests was proposed by Prof. Strigul from Stevens Institute of Technology.
